# TAZVERA Chain — Core Security Repair Package v1

**Status: local prototype only. Not a testnet, not mainnet, and not the existing Shardeum TZV token. Do not use real funds or production/private wallet keys.**

This package replaces the broken Phase-1 core with a small, buildable C++20 foundation. It deliberately does **not** implement networking, validators, consensus, staking, smart contracts, a wallet, explorer, or persistence.

## What this package includes

- Real Ed25519 signing and verification through OpenSSL EVP (no placeholder `return true`).
- SHA-256 hashing through OpenSSL EVP.
- Transaction signatures cover protocol version, chain ID, sender, recipient, amount, fee, nonce, expiry, and public key.
- Sender address is checked against the transaction public key.
- Fixed prototype transfer fee of 1000 utzv; 100% burn in this local model. This is not a final or approved mainnet fee.
- Nonce, fee, balance, expiry, chain ID, signature, and integer overflow checks.
- Canonically ordered state map and deterministic state root.
- Block hash commits to block metadata, every transaction ID, and state root.
- Block execution uses a temporary state copy; if any transaction fails, no partial state is committed.
- CMake builds the library, demo, and tests; CTest runs the tests.

## Requirements

- C++20 compiler
- CMake 3.20 or newer
- OpenSSL 3.x development headers/libraries

Ubuntu/Debian example:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libssl-dev
```

## Build and test

Run from this folder:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
./build/taz_demo
```

The test suite checks valid signatures, modified-signature rejection, wrong-chain rejection, transfer accounting, fee burn, replay/nonce rejection, atomic block failure, and block-hash commitment.

## Important limitations and next work

1. This is a repaired local core only. A successful local build is not proof of blockchain security.
2. No P2P networking, consensus, validator registration, staking, slashing, persistence, RPC, JSON protocol, wallet, or smart contracts are included.
3. The prototype uses one fixed transfer fee. Congestion policy, fee governance, validator economics, and the long-term sustainability of a finite staking reserve still need formal design.
4. The 100% fee-burn choice means transaction fees do not pay validators. Resolve validator rewards before public testnet/mainnet.
5. The address derivation here is a prototype convention, not a finalized public address standard.
6. Cryptographic code uses OpenSSL's Ed25519 implementation; do not invent custom cryptography.
7. Independent review, fuzzing, multi-node determinism tests, and a professional security audit are required before any real-value deployment.

## Existing project warning

Keep this independent-chain prototype separate from the existing Shardeum Mainnet TZV asset. This code does not bridge, migrate, wrap, or convert that asset.
